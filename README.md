# tinycore-linux-vdi
VDI files of TinyCore Linux ready to run. They're helpful when testing software which allows for importing custom virtual machine images, because they actually boot and are very small in size.

Repository contains:
- CorePure64_x86-64.vdi - 64-bit version, ~24MB, needs 96MB of RAM
- Core_x86.vdi - 32-bit version, ~18MB, needs 64MB of RAM
